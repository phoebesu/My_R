# Levene's Test is non-significant at F(2, 12) = 0.1176 and p = 0.89
# Levene's test indicates that the variances are not significantly different
# Homogeneity of variance is ok

# Graph - this gets very fancy by placing 2 points for the mean to give the appearance of a dot with a border
# 
# From the graph we see that the error bars overlap from one mean to the next and that there seems to 
# be a linear trend as the data changes
