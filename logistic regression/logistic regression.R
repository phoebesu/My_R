# "Cured" to the opposite of what R defaulted them to be

eelData$Intervention <- relevel(eelData$Intervention, "No Treatment")

# 
# OK, that looks better. Let's get on with some logistic regression
# Use the glm() method, and use the Intervention variable as a predictor of 
# Cured outcome. In addition, specify the family of distributions to use as 
# the binomial distribution with the default link logit link function.
#
eelModel.1 <- glm(Cured ~ Intervention, data = eelData, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
#
# Now let's add to the model Duration and create a second model 
eelModel.2 <- glm(Cured ~ Intervention + Duration, data = eelData, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
#
# Let's see what we've got 
summary(eelModel.1)
summary(eelModel.2)
#
# Based on the model summaries, Intervention is statistically significanly different
# from zero, p < .003, but Duration is not.
# The chi square statistic on the first model is the difference between the two
# residual deviances (null deviande and residual deviance) = 154.08 - 144.16
print(154.08-144.16)   # 9.93
#
# Let's compute the chi square form the model itself
#
eelModel.1.chisq <- eelModel.1$null.deviance - eelModel.1$deviance
#
# We can calculate the probablity of the chi square statistic with the following
chisq.prob <- 1 - pchisq(eelModel.1$null.deviance - eelModel.1$deviance, eelModel.1$df.null - eelModel.1$df.residual)
#
# p < .002 based on the above calculation, so we can reject the null hypothesis
# that the model is no better than chance at predicting the outcome.
# Therefore: including Intervention in the model produced a significant improvement
# in the fit of the model, chi-sq(1) = 9.93, p = .002.
#
# If we examine the coefficients for model 1, we see that Intervention is a 
# significant predictor of being cured, b = 1.23, z = 3.07, p = .002
#
# Calculating the various R values for this model (model 1)
# 
# First, the standard R
# sqrt((z^2 - 2*degFreedom)/null deviance)
print(sqrt((3.074^2-(2*1))/154.08))   # this is pulling data from the summary display

# it a little easier to deal with then we compute R

# The values of the confidence interval ends are greater than 1, which means as the predictor
# increases, so do the odds of being cured. Values less than one mean that as the predictor 
# increases the odds of being cured decrease. Since we observed that the direction was an 
# increase is odds with an increase of predictor variable, this corresponds and supports that
# observation. Furthermore, since the confidence interval doesn't go below 1 then it doesn't 
# include the chance that in the population the direction of the relationship is opposite to 
# what we observed.

# Model #2 Analysis - Adding Duration

# The b value is very small and not significant, p = 0.964. The deviance between the models
